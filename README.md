# UX/UI Design Showcase

Welcome to my collection of UX/UI design projects! This repository contains various design works, including wireframes, prototypes, and UI designs
that demonstrate my skills and design process.

## About This Repository

This repository is a portfolio of different UX/UI design projects I've worked on. It includes designs for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products. 
I continuously update this repository with new designs to showcase my progress and exploration of various design styles, tools, and techniques.

## Design Process

1. Research:
   - For each design, I focus on understanding the target audience, their needs, and the productâ€™s goals.
   - I conduct competitor analysis to ensure my designs are relevant and innovative.

2. Wireframes:
   - I create low-fidelity wireframes to map out the basic structure and layout of each design.
   - Wireframes help to visualize user flows and ensure a user-centered design approach.

3. Prototypes:
   - I design interactive prototypes to demonstrate how users will interact with the product.
   - These prototypes can be tested to gather feedback and iterate on design ideas.

4. Final UI Designs:
   - I refine the designs, focusing on visual aesthetics, usability, and accessibility.

## Projects Included

Below is a list of the different types of designs included in this repository:

- Website Designs: User-friendly website layouts with an emphasis on modern aesthetics and clean interfaces.
- Mobile App Designs: UI designs for mobile applications that prioritize usability and smooth navigation.
- Wireframes & Prototypes: Low-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes demonstrating key user flows and interactions.

Each design project will be organized in separate folders for easy navigation.
